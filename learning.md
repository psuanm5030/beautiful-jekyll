subtitle: My Continuous Learning Journey
---

In 2014, after hearing from a colleague about a site called “Coursera," I started to get interested in MOOCs (Massive Open Online Classes) and online, supplemental education in general.  At first, I never intended to change my career, but rather just supplement skills, however I became addicted / passionate about the emerging area of data science.  

I believe this type of learning is the future.  The low cost & barriers to entry (no acceptance, etc.), excellent platforms, and outstanding (some famous) professors makes this method ideal for learners like me.  

Below I have listed most of the courses I have taken, with some summary detail and likes to the courses and my projects.  This is my record of learning!

# Currently Taking

## [Intro to HTML and CSS](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-html-and-css--ud304)   

**Udacity**   
October 2017  

Lately (and really for the past 1-2 years) I have wanted to have a personal webpage to share my experiences.  I fooled around with Wordpress and recently started pushing my website through [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).  During this, I was always trying to customize something and felt that I needed to get the fundamentals down!  This course was on point, in terms of "Intro."  I wish there was more to it, but it was a great start.   

## [Advanced SQL for Data Scientists](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/advanced-sql-for-data-scientists/tips-for-using-sql-for-data-science)   

**LinkedIn Learning**   
September 2017  

I have spent years using SQL, however, mostly through other tools that wrap it in their GUI.  I wanted to finally spend some time learning the foundational elements.  This course was put together nicely and had very little unnecessary fluff.  

## [Udacity – Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002?v=a4) 
*7 classes over the course of 12 months*  
August 2015 - June 2016  

In July 2015, I decided to participate and dedicate myself to completing Udacity’s Data Analyst Nanodegree program.  The program was estimated to take ~18 months, so my decision was well thought through.  I wanted something that was going to be challenging, but also I wanted some sort of credential.  And I wanted something that was more robust than a single class or a single discipline.  I also considered a Master’s degree, but to be honest, a Master’s was infinitely more expensive and it didn’t fit my need for the course to conform to my life.  I also believe that formal degrees can be overrated, particularly around a topic like data science, where I believe that most of the learning is done proactively by the learner, outside of a classroom.  

I completed the degree program, and its 7 classes, roughly 10 months later.  In retrospect, it was tough.  Not only did you complete lectures, quizzes and exercises, but there was a project for each course.  All of this took time, and I sacrificed a lot of weekends and early mornings to get this done timely.  In the end it was worth every penny and hour.  I learned things that I could apply to my own little pet projects, as well as, my everyday work.

**Below is a summary of each course I completed:**  

### Statistics  

This was the primer on Statistics that I was looking for, covering everything from central limit theorem and distributions to confidence intervals.  

**PROJECT: TEST A PERCEPTUAL PHENOMENON**  

This project involved using descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the [Stroop effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect), a classic result of experimental psychology. It was my responsibility to analyze the data and use statistical inference to draw a conclusion based on the results.

### Intro to Data Analysis  

This course took my background of Python (through previous courses above) and turned it into practical skill, using tools like NumPy and Pandas to manipulate data simply.  

**PROJECT: INVESTIGATE A DATASET**  

This particular project involved a large dataset consisting of turnstile data from New York subways, along with weather information.  Using NumPy and Pandas, I munged and analyzed the dataset in an effort to answer this question: “Do more people ride the NYC subway when it is raining or when it is not raining?”.  Check the link below to see the my conclusion!

### Data Extraction and Wrangling  

During this course I was exposed to a new technology, MongoDB, a document-based database.  I learned how to create a functional database by wrangling and cleansing data, then graduating to creating pipelines to functionally query these databases.  

**PROJECT: WRANGLE OPENSTREETMAP DATA**  

For this project, I used MongoDB and my learned data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data ([https://www.openstreetmap.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org)) for a part of the world that you care about — which is Pittsburgh, PA!

### Exploratory Data Analysis  

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a foundational skill.  This course incorporated R, covering the spectrum from loading data to investigating it.  However, this course was critical in that it effectively explained the way to examine the relationships amongst variables.  I enjoyed the project which allowed me to perform my own interrogation of a dataset of my choosing.  I choose a data set on wine quality (see [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality)).  

**PROJECT: EXPLORE AND SUMMARIZE DATA**  

This was likely my favorite project (although it rivals the following project), as I was able to take a dataset like Wine Quality ([link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality)) and work my through it methodically, trying to understand what drives the quality of wine.  I put my R skills and applied exploratory data analysis techniques to good use.

### Machine Learning  

Finally, into the meaty stuff!  This machine learning course really put my python skills to test, while teaching me the gamut of common algorithms and showing me how to check the accuracy of each.  As an auditor and CPA, the project and course time spent on the Enron email dataset was extremely interesting.  

**PROJECT: IDENTIFY FRAUD FROM ENRON EMAIL**  

This project was especially interesting for two reasons: 1) I was intensely curious about machine learning, and 2) Enron was something taught in all my accounting classes at college.   The class that proceeded this project was really in-depth regarding ML algorithms and this project forced me to test them all, eventually settling on a combination (ensemble) of algorithms to try and detect “persons of interest” from a HUGE email dataset.

### Data Visualization  

Data visualization is my passion and truly how I got started down this path, so I was excited to begin this course.  Thankfully, I am fairly skilled in Tableau and this course didn’t use it!  I say “thankfully” because I am more interested in learning a new technology / language, and in this case, it was D3.  D3 is a javascript library for producing interactive visualizations for the web (wikipedia [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D3.js)).  I will admit that learning D3 is tough and requires baby steps and lots of practice.  The course taught me so much more than D3 though, as it focused heavily on data visualizations principles, which is something I am passionate about.  

**PROJECT: MAKE EFFECTIVE DATA VISUALIZATION**  

This turned out to be one of the hardest projects, however one of the most rewarding.  The difficulty came with the programming, as D3.js is a tough skill to pickup and can be extremely frustrating.  Regardless, I loved putting my understanding of data viz principles to work to analyze and create a store from the Titanic passenger dataset.  Overall, my work was a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, including as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

### A/B Testing  

Finally was A/B testing, which was much more intense than expected.  The course was enlightening as it was taught by some experts from google, who were pioneers with evaluating web design and functionality.  

**PROJECT: DESIGN AN A/B TEST**  

Final project revolved around understanding and designing an A/B test for a theoretical change to the Udacity website.  Within this project I had to make design decisions for the test, including which metrics to measure and how long the test should be run.  Ultimately I had to decide, using the results of my analysis, whether to recommend launching the change or not.

## [Statistics for Business – I](https://www.edx.org/course/statistics-business-i-iimbx-qm101-1x-0)

**IIMBx**
June 2015 - July 2015  

This was somewhat of a filler course for me post my experience with “The Analytic’s Edge” (which was incredible — see above), as I felt I needed a primer on statistics, as I was deciding my future class / degree (explained below).  Overall, this was heavy on basic excel functions, and while it did teach me a few things, it was not the statistics primer I was looking for — should have realized that the word “Business” often is a way to say that it is both: 1) incorporating real-life examples, and 2) meant for everybody — i.e. diluted.  

## [The Analytics Edge](https://www.edx.org/course/analytics-edge-mitx-15-071x-3)  

**MIT** 
April 2015 - June 2015  

Taking this class changed everything for me.  This was course that did the opposite of what I previously had, which was foundationally learning a programming language.  This course taught me a new language, R ([wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language))), using REAL-world examples.  I learned from cases such as Moneyball and the Framington Heart Study ([wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framingham_Heart_Study)), and so many more.  I was surprised how I could learn a language this way!  Two things contributed to this: 1) R is an easier, less-intimidating language to learn, and 2) I supplemented my learning with lots of google — which I think is a very efficient way of learning.  However, the greatest contributor to learning R was engaging examples (so thank you to the creators).  **If I were to recommend any class, it would be this one.**  

## [6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-11)  

**MIT**  
February 2015 - April 2015  

After getting my feet wet with Python, I was looking for a class that would enhance my coding skills.  This course was everything I was looking for and more.  Not 0nly did it enhance my foundational knowledge of the language, but it provided several thought-provoking exercises and examples.  I learned about functions, classes and other techniques such as recursion.  It was a tough course but it stretched me in the right ways, keeping me fully interested.  

## [Programming for Everybody (Getting started with python)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python)  

**Michigan University**  
November 2014 - January 2015  

My first foray and a great start for somebody that had a hidden passion for working with technology, but zero coding experience!  Once I took this course, I was hooked.
