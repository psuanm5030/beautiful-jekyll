### Tableau Conference 2015

**Session Title:** Mylan's Risk-Aware, Fact-Based Decision-Making With the Internal Audit Function  

**Brief:** Mylan’s Internal Audit department is positioned to lead change throughout the organization. The team can easily move across departmental silos, has access to information, and is well connected to upper levels of management. Mylan is doing more with less, upending the traditional audit approach with risk-based sampling, using analytics to expand coverage and enable efficient and prioritized sampling.  

Learn how EY advises their clients to take this approach one step further — using Tableau to create head office and local in-country management dashboards to socialize the risk-based approach, and monitor for global bribery and corruption risk.

### Alteryx Inspire 2017

**Session Title:** A Prescription for HR and M&A Analytics Success

**Brief:** One of the world's leading generics and specialty pharmaceutical companies, Mylan markets its products in approximately 165 countries and territories with a workforce of 35,000+ employees. Having experienced significant growth over the last 10 years—primarily through acquisitions—the company recognized that analytics played a key role in its successful on-boarding of new employees.  

In this session, you'll hear how Mylan's analytics team partnered with the company's HR department to find previously elusive answers to several critical questions. You'll also find out how HR led an effort to adopt a self-service analytics toolset, consisting of Alteryx and Tableau, to collaborate more efficiently and reduce its reliance on IT resources. And you'll get a deep-dive into two Alteryx-enabled projects that helped HR better understand the value of an analytics mindset.

### 2017 University of Pittsburgh

**Session Title:** Data visualization with Tableau  

**Brief:** I have been a committee member for the University of Pittsburgh Industry Analytics Council, providing guidance regarding their relatively new analytics certificate program.  

In September, I was invited to speak to roughly 60 students regarding data visualization and the tool Tableau.  These sessions are rewarding because many of these students have never seen how easy and valuable it can be to use a tool like Tableau.  This particular presentation had a meme spin to it!
