I am amazed with the sheer number of "things" (technologies, tools, languages, and frameworks) that are available (and open-source!).  Not only that, but the world is constantly refactoring itself to make these "things" better.  It is an exciting time to be alive and I am thrilled that to be part of this generation.   

In the last few years, I have embraced learning a variety of new "things" to build out my personal skill-set, while giving myself the breadth of knowledge to be able to tackle any problem or approach any scenario with an expansive mindset.  

I created this master listing for myself, as I frequently found myself listing my skills in various places, often forgetting a few "things" that I actually had some experience with or knowledge of.  *I also wanted to document some of my key intangible strengths, because these are often under-appreciated and forgotten, despite their huge value to myself or my clients.*

Without further ado, here is my listing the "things" that I felt I had experienced enough to consider it part of **my repertoire.**  

### ![item](/psuanm5030.github.io/img/icons/user.png) Solutioning  
**Skill | Intangible**  
While data is my passion, my true love is the "Solutioning" aspect of making data insightful and consumable.  This means taking something raw and without process, and making it something efficient, effective and valuable.  I lean on my creative, problem-solving skills paired with my experience and knowledge of a growing number of languages / frameworks to make solutions.  

### ![item](/psuanm5030.github.io/img/icons/018-tools.png) Tableau  
**Tool | Visualization**  
I have been using Tableau for half a decade now, enabling projects of all sizes, types and levels of importance for a variety of audiences.  I am very comfortable with all facets of the tool and enjoy designing visual analytics that are consumable.  

### ![item](/psuanm5030.github.io/img/icons/010-layers-1.png) Python  
**Language (Dynamic) | Data Analysis / Everything**  
Python changed my life.  I started with the most basic Coursera course learning what an integer vs. float mean, and now am proud to say that I can use Python to enable a variety of needs.  I have used Python as a scripting tool to analyze / parse data.  I have used it to create tools that helped uncover fraud in enterprise expense data.  I have used Python to create Fantasy Football drafting applications, complete with a front-end and back-end, for use during Fantasy drafts.  This is my favorite language / tool / skill (it is all of those things) and I love the thrill of solving problems with it!   

### ![item](/psuanm5030.github.io/img/icons/user.png) Communication / Storytelling  
**Skill | Intangible**  
This skill initially developed for me during my time in an Internal Audit department where I had exposure to leaders and professionals of all levels.  I had experiences that not many do at a young professional level, where each week I was digging into a new process or area (i.e., finance, compliance, operations), understanding it completely, validating it and then reporting my findings to people that enabled that process everyday.  There were a lot of lessons learned over time, but my ability to speak to something intelligently was vastly improved.  I graduated from Internal Audit to other areas of the business where I was analyzing critical company strategy through data, then presenting to the CEO, CFO, CIO, COO, etc.  Finally, I should mention that I branched out into speaking at Conferences (2015 Tableau and 2017 Alteryx) which got me in front of my toughest critics, my peers.  All of these experiences were vastly important in my development as a communicator.  I learned to speak passionately and concisely.  

### ![item](/psuanm5030.github.io/img/icons/user.png) Program / Process Development  
**Skill | Intangible**  
I have always loved building things that can exist and improve over time.  I was lucky to join a brand new audit department as the 3rd employee that is now 20 people and take pride in my hand in developing their ethos, organization processes and materials.  From there, I took on the task of building the analytics program for Internal Audit.  This allowed me to unleash my passion of analytics and build something real.  I was able to show real value, enough that the sub-department is now staffed by 2 people full-time.  My success with Audit Analytics led me to be a founder of the Enterprise Data & Strategic Analytics department, where I creating an analytics Center of Excellence, empowering and enabling high-value analytics projects, along with hundreds of analysts hungry for self-service analytics.  

### ![item](/psuanm5030.github.io/img/icons/010-layers-1.png) R  
**Language (Dynamic) | Data Analysis**  
Soon after discovering Python, I took a course with MITx (through EdX) entitled "The Analytics Edge".  This course introduced me to a number of modelling algorithms (i.e., linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, CART, etc.).  Most importantly this course taught me how a tool like R could be leveraged in the real world to solve real problems.  I incorporated R into many analytics projects and it is my preferred tool for doing exploratory data analysis.  

### ![item](/psuanm5030.github.io/img/icons/018-tools.png) EasyMorph  
**Tool | Data Manipulation**  
Discovered this tool in late 2017 when frustrated with Alteryx (expensive and poor sales tactics).  We all need a good data manipulation tool and EasyMorph does this good, however its real value is in its cheap and well-done extensibility.  My love of solutioning relies on tools like this to make solutions efficient, reliable, and automated.  

### ![item](/psuanm5030.github.io/img/icons/user.png) Report Writing  
**Skill | Intangible**  
Similar to communication and presentation skills are report writing.  This skill is critical to developing insightful and consumable analyses.  I have always believed in ensuring that you have a goal, a process and a deliverable - and report writing in the canvas to all this work.  Over my years, I have practiced report writing with Internal Audits (i.e., developing and documenting audit findings for various processes and controls) to data analysis (i.e., understanding the domain, analyzing the data, and documenting / sharing insights).    

### ![item](/psuanm5030.github.io/img/icons/006-computer.png) Pandas  
**Framework | Data Manipulation**  
Pandas is one of those rare frameworks that is so useful that I find it hard to fathom that it's completely free and open-source.  I have had extensive experience in manipulating data in dataframes and believe its something very core to working with data in Python.  

### ![item](/psuanm5030.github.io/img/icons/018-tools.png) Alteryx  
**Tool | Data Manipulation**  
I have been using Alteryx for years now and feel comfortable with the tool in many facets.  It's a very competent and robust tool.  I have used Alteryx to enable automated solutions that work with up to a hundred gigabytes of data.   

### ![item](/psuanm5030.github.io/img/icons/006-computer.png) Markdown  
**Language (Writing) | Data Presentation / Writing**  
Markdown is a very simple language that has allowed me to document my analyses in a efficient and effective   

### ![item](/psuanm5030.github.io/img/icons/006-computer.png) Git  
**Framework | Enablement (Code)**  
Without Git, how would I track or share anything!    

### ![item](/psuanm5030.github.io/img/icons/006-computer.png) SQLAlchemy  
**Framework | Enablement (Data)**  
I got a heavy dose of SQLAlchemy when I started building my Fantasy Football drafting tool.  This was a really fun project for me, as I engineered something useful in a full-stack way.  This included acquiring, cleaning, wrangling and storing data, then developing my own scoring system, and finally creating a GUI to utilize during the drafting process which interacted with the data using SQLAlchemy.  Learned a lot here.  

### ![item](/psuanm5030.github.io/img/icons/018-tools.png) Pycharm and R-Studio  
**Tool | Enablement (Code)**  
These are both my IDEs of choice for coding in python or R.  It is incredible what is packed into these tools.  I started with pycharm early on in my python coding development and was out of my league.  I didn't even know how to use the debugger.  However, over time I learned these tools inside out and gained so many efficiencies.    

### ![item](/psuanm5030.github.io/img/icons/014-browser.png) Jekyll  
**Framework | Web Framework**  
VizElement.com was built on the Jekyll framework.  I spent a great deal of time exploring the hundreds of ways there are to create websites, from simple HTML / CSS on a Raspberry Pi to a fully hosted solution with wordpress.  Ultimately my needs were simple - communicate my consultancy on the internet.  I didn't require a lot of dynamic content, so a static solution like Jekyll was perfect.  It is simple and mostly based on the transformation of markdown to html.  

### ![item](/psuanm5030.github.io/img/icons/server.png) Docker  
**Technology | Enablement (Code)**  
Docker is an amazing technology that I wish I used more.  My experience with coding environments has been very frustrating at times.  I learned how to create virtual environments, which made portability of code easier, however docker is the next evolution of that.  It provides a "container" which is an entire environment that can operate on any machine that runs docker!  I used docker initially for Fantasy Football purposes.  See, I wanted a small application that would request any transactions in my leagues using python and the Yahoo Fantasy API.  That worked great on my local machine, however I took my local machine everywhere and most of the time it was asleep or not connected to the internet.  Therefore I used the AWS Elastic Container Service which allowed you to deploy containers to and provisioned machines to run the container round the clock.  Ultimately I ditched that solution for AWS lambda which removed the need for me to provision machines!  

### ![item](/psuanm5030.github.io/img/icons/server.png) AWS - Lambda  
**Technology | Enablement (Code)**  
As mentioned with Docker, I found this technology when I was frustrated with AWS EC2 machines running for an application that was extremely simple (Fantasy Football Transaction Check).  With AWS Lambda, you can trigger code snippets without worrying about servers.  Therefore, I was able to deploy my python virtual environment to Lambda and hook it up to a cron job that run the snippet every 15 mins!  Perfectly simple.  What a tool!  

### ![item](/psuanm5030.github.io/img/icons/018-tools.png) ACL (Audit Command Language)  
**Tool | Data Manipulation**  
ACL was what started it all for me.  For other people, they might say pascal or visual basic or java.  For me, I was an accountant working in an internal audit department, so my first tool was a very industry-specific scripting language.  Basically ACL is a simple language that reads in data then allows you to filter, join, find fuzzy duplicates, or take random samples.  It isn't anything special, but has been around since the 80s (and has recently transformed themselves), and has a strong grip with the audit industry.  Regardless, this tool let me cut my teeth on data wrangling and analysis.  I am grateful for this tool!  

### ![item](/psuanm5030.github.io/img/icons/server.png) AWS - RDS  
**Technology | Data Storage**  
Storing data somewhere that isn't on my local machine was important for me because 1) my machine was getting cluttered, and 2) I wanted my data to be available no matter what machine i was using.  Enter AWS RDS, a cloud database environment.  I am by no means a DBA, but I have gained great value using this toolset.  

### ![item](/psuanm5030.github.io/img/icons/server.png) AWS - ECS  
**Technology | Enablement (Code)**  
As mentioned with Docker, AWS offers a repository for your docker containers and enables you the ability to deploy the containers very flexibly.  I spent some time figuring out how tasks and clusters work with the containers, but ultimately got what I needed from this cloud tool.  

### ![item](/psuanm5030.github.io/img/icons/005-computer-1.png) SQL  
**Language | Data Manipulation**  
SQL to me is a very foundational language that has been the basis for many of the tools I use.  For instance, Tableau has their own VizQL variant of the language that drives the visualization backend for the tool.  Also, with Alteryx and EasyMorph, these tools take a lot of ques from that language.  I rarely need to write pure SQL because I use so many tools and packages that abstract and augment the language for me.    

### ![item](/psuanm5030.github.io/img/icons/014-browser.png) Flask  
**Framework | Web Framework**  
Flask is a fun little framework that I have used to develop basic web sites.  I like it because it is python based and very easy to use.   

### ![item](/psuanm5030.github.io/img/icons/006-computer.png) Pip / Conda / VirtualEnv / RegEx  
**Framework | Enablement (Code)**  
I have always believed that using python or R requires a good foundational understanding of key system tools, such as pip and virtual environments.  They allow great efficiencies when using these tools.  RegEx is one of those languages that I have used extensively when in I was looking for fraud in internal audit.  I am no master of any of these system enablement tools but I do consider them critical to be able to write code efficiently and effectively.  

### ![item](/psuanm5030.github.io/img/icons/005-computer-1.png) MongoDB  
**Language | Data Storage / Manipulation**  
In 2015-2016 I completed Udacity's Data Analyst nanodegree, which was a robust program covering technologies and disciplines from data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, machine learning, data visualization, to A/B testing.  One of the tools that we used heavily for data wrangling component was MongoDB.  Using a document-based database was a new paradigm for me and I enjoyed it.  I even used it to store some of the data supporting my fantasy football analysis.    

### ![item](/psuanm5030.github.io/img/icons/014-browser.png) HTML / CSS  
**Language | Web Framework**  
I took an HTML / CSS class (Udacity) in the Fall of 2017 because I felt like I didn't have the fundamentals of this fundamental web language.  While I don't use it heavily, I am often working with reporting that requires a component of HTML, or more recently, with my consultancies web site based on Jekyll.  While Jekyll abstracts a lot of the HTML / CSS away, there are always tweaks that need to be made to make pages sharp!  

### ![item](/psuanm5030.github.io/img/icons/014-browser.png) Javascript  
**Language | Web Framework**  
I took an Javascript class (EdX) in the Fall of 2017 because I felt that this was a core language that I didn't have experience with.  I utilized Javascript and the React package to create some interesting functionality in websites. I am no expert, but I am dangerous!  

### ![item](/psuanm5030.github.io/img/icons/server.png) AWS - General (Route 53)  
**Technology | Web Technology**  
As a part of managing my own consultancies website, I have grown closer to the inner workings of the web, including domain / DNS management.  I now manage my website through the combination of AWS Route 53, AWS Cloudfront, AWS S3 and Jekyll.  I am not a domain administrator or strive to be, but I am handy enough to make the technologies work to support my needs!
