subtitle: An Incomplete Repetoire

In this every changing technology-focused world, I am always learning new skills.  I wish I had time to master these, but as you probably know, there are literally thousands of tools, technologies, frameworks and disciplines.  This is a listing of these "things" that I have had some experience with, what level i consider myself, and possibly why I used / learned it!  

This is definitely an incomplete list, but everything on listed below is here for some reason.  


| Skill | Level | Thoughts                                                                                                                                        |

| **Tableau**   | Proficient  | I have been using Tableau for half a decade now, enabling projects of all sizes, types and levels of importance for a variety of audiences.  I am very comfortable with all facets of the tool and enjoy designing visual analytics that are consumable.  |

**Frameworks**  

- I'm **passionate** about the varying disciplines of data science.
- I believe that your college and degree do NOT define you or your ability.
- I love coding with python (and R to a lesser extent).  
- I've presented to and advised C-Suite executives for years, experiences I am thankful to have collected, as effective presentation skills are highly valued in corporate America.  
- I get creative in Tableau with data and have honed my knowledge of working with data at various levels to make insights visible.
- I also use data science in my personal life too.  Everything from fantasy football to my wife's baby feeding data!   
- I love being engaged in my work and crave projects that require thinking.  
- I enjoy building processes / capabilities - particularly analytics capabilities, where my experience lies.
