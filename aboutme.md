I've been working for a Fortune 500 company leading their visualization and self-service analytics initiative.  My day-to-day consists of leading a “Center of Excellence,” engraining a culture of doing more with the data we have, utilizing our best resource — our people.  I also support executive dashboard projects.  I have a passion enabling visual analytics in a variety of ways.

I first started my career becoming a CPA and auditor of financial, operational, and compliance related processes.  Then I changed paths, focusing on audit analytics, searching for fraud and inefficiencies using analytics.  This then led me to my current position as the leader of our Visualization and Self-Service department.  

Here are some key things to know about me: 

- I'm **passionate** about the varying disciplines of data science.
- I believe that your college and degree do NOT define you or your ability.
- I love coding with python (and R to a lesser extent).  
- I've presented to and advised C-Suite executives for years, experiences I am thankful to have collected, as effective presentation skills are highly valued in corporate America.  
- I get creative in Tableau with data and have honed my knowledge of working with data at various levels to make insights visible.
- I also use data science in my personal life too.  Everything from fantasy football to my wife's baby feeding data!   
- I love being engaged in my work and crave projects that require thinking.  
- I enjoy building processes / capabilities - particularly analytics capabilities, where my experience lies.
