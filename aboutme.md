![Andy Pick](/psuanm5030.github.io/img/profile-picture-768x1024.jpg){:float: left; margin: 4px 10px 0px 0px; border: 1px solid #000000;"} My name is Andy Miller.  

I've been working for a Fortune 500 company leading their visualization and self-service analytics initiative.  My day-to-day consists of leading a “Center of Excellence,” engraining a culture of doing more with the data we have, utilizing our best resource – our people.  I also support executive dashboard projects.  I have a passion enabling visual analytics in a variety of ways.

I first started my career becoming a CPA and auditor of financial, operational and compliance related processes.  Then I changed paths, focusing on audit analytics, searching for fraud and inefficiencies using analytics, before taking on my current position as the leader of our Visualization and Self-Service department. 

Here are some key things to know about me: 

- I have a beautiful wife and a red-headed daughter (very very cute).
- I'm passionate about the varying disciplines of data science.
- I believe that your college and degree do NOT define you or your ability.
- I love coding with python (and R to a lesser extent).  
- I get creative in Tableau with data and have honed my knowledge of working with data at various levels to make insights visible.
- I love being engaged in my work and crave projects that require thinking.
