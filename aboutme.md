I've currently lead data visualization for a Fortune 500 pharmaceutical company.  My day-to-day consists of leading a team of data scientists and visualization experts to drive value through improving corporate performance with analytics.  In this role, I lead Mylan's global “Center of Excellence,” engraining a culture of doing more with the data we have, utilizing our best resource — our people.  I have a passion enabling visual analytics in a variety of ways, using a variety of tools.

I began my career working for Ernst & Young, a large professional services firm, becoming a CPA while working as an auditor of financial, operational, and compliance related processes & controls.  I then took an opportunity at a young Internal Audit department within a growing pharmaceutical company where I led audits around the world.  I soon became infatuated with analytics and focused on developing an audit analytics program to enable more efficient and effective audit practices.  This led to me joining the Strategic Analytics function as a founding member.

Here are some key things to know about me: 

- I'm **passionate** about the varying disciplines of data science.
- I believe that your college and degree do NOT define you or your ability.
- I love coding with python (and R to a lesser extent).  
- I've presented to and advised C-Suite executives for years, experiences I am thankful to have collected, as effective presentation skills are highly valued in corporate America.  
- I get creative in Tableau with data and have honed my knowledge of working with data at various levels to make insights visible.
- I also use data science in my personal life too.  Everything from fantasy football to my wife's baby feeding data!   
- I love being engaged in my work and crave projects that require thinking.  
- I enjoy building processes / capabilities - particularly analytics capabilities, where my experience lies.
