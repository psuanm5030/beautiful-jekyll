My name is Andy Miller.  I've been working for a Fortune 500 company leading their visualization and self-service analytics initiative.    

You should know the following things about me: 

- I have a beautiful wife and a red-headed daughter (very very cute).
- I'm passionate about the varying disciplines of data science.
- I believe that your college and degree do NOT define you or your ability.
- I love coding with python (and R to a lesser extent).  
- I get creative in Tableau with data and have honed my knowledge of working with data at various levels to make insights visible.
- I love being engaged in my work and crave projects that require thinking.
